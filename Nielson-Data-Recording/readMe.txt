This is a script to automate the recording of Nielson Data.

It will prompt you to enter what input you want to record the Nielson data, name of the file you want to save in, and name of the Nielson stream.

Be sure to have the Nielson license on the card you want to perform recording on, and also have the card on master build. Nielson recoding is only available on master builds.
